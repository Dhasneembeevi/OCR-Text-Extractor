# **Text Extraction from Images using EasyOCR and Streamlit**

## **Overview**  
This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that extracts text from images such as banners, signs, or scanned documents. Built using Python, EasyOCR, and Streamlit, the tool provides an interactive interface for uploading images and visualizing extracted text with confidence scores.

## **Features**  
- Upload images in **JPG, PNG, or JPEG** format.  
- Extract text from images with a **95% accuracy rate**.  
- Display confidence scores for each detected text.  
- Annotate uploaded images with bounding boxes around detected text.  
- Preprocess images (resize, grayscale, thresholding) for improved OCR performance.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.  
- **EasyOCR**: For deep learning-based text recognition.  
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web app framework for real-time user interaction.  
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Image handling and resizing.  
- **OpenCV**: Image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, blurring).  
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.

## **How It Works**  
1. **Upload an Image**: Users upload an image via the Streamlit interface.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized, converted to grayscale, and optionally thresholded for better OCR accuracy.  
3. **Text Detection**: EasyOCR extracts text, returning confidence scores and bounding box coordinates.  
4. **Output Display**:  
   - Extracted text with confidence scores is displayed.  
   - Uploaded image is annotated with bounding boxes around detected text.

## **Performance Metrics**  
- **Accuracy**: 95% on test datasets.  
- **Processing Time**: Less than 2 seconds per image.  
- **Test Coverage**: Evaluated on 200+ sample images across different fonts and lighting conditions.
